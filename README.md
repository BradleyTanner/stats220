# My Experience with Programming

This repository has been created for my **STATS 220** class.
I have *zero* experience in programming so this is all new to me.

Throughout my degree, I'm planning on taking 3 programming related courses:
* STATS 220
* GISCI 242*
* GISCI 343*
  - (GISCI stand for geographical information science)

# My Degree

At the [University of Auckland, Waipapa Taumata Rau](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) I started with studying Psychology but began studying Geography after my first semester.

## Psychology or Geography

To put it simply, psychology was boring. I wanted to be a clinical psyhcologist but when I started to learn about behaviourism and neuropsychology, my interest began to wane. 
And then I learnt how *painfully* competitive it is to get into a clinical psychology program at tertiary level.
At the beginning of my second semester in my first year, I jumped ships to Geography after falling in love with GEOG 102, a human geography course.

## So Why Programming?

After studying Geography for my Bachelors, I'm thinking of studying Urban Planning for my Masters. Urban Planners use software like ArcGIS to analyse spatial information related to demography, land use patterns, and flood zones.
Furthermore, many urban planners use python to automate tasks and perform complex spatial processes.
